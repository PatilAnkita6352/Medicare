              Pune had already been blessed by the generous contribution of Sassoon- a Jewish merchant family in the form of the David Sassoon Hospital (Old Sassoon Building) built at a cost of Rs. 213,000 serving the poor and needy from 1867, and the Jacob Sassoon Hospital constructed by his nephew in 1905-06 to relieve the congestion on the David Sassoon Hospital. Both were magnificent buildings, architectural marvels and the clock tower of David Sassoon Hospital, a landmark in the city. The campus had already been blessed by the presence of two great personalities - Avtar Meher Baba was born in the old maternity ward in the hospital, and the father of the nation, Mahatma, Gandhi was operated upon for emergency appendectomy in 1924 by a British Surgeon Col. Murdoch with an Indian anaesthetist Dr. Datey in attendance.

            <h3>KEM Hospital</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
            Serving the healthcare needs of people in the Pune District of Maharashtra State in India since 1912, KEM Hospital, Pune, has grown to be one of the largest private hospitals in the region. KEM Hospital is run by the KEM Hospital Society, a registered charitable trust.
          </p>
            <p class="fst-italic">
            What began with 4 maternity beds, is now a 550+ bedded multi-specialty tertiary level teaching institution. Much of the growth was spearheaded by the dynamic and visionary Dr. Banoo Coyaji, who was appointed as the Chief Medical Officer in 1944 and was awarded the Padma Bhushan and Magsaysay Awards. The hospital is particularly known for some of its Centres of Excellence many of which were the first of their kind in Pune and the surrounding region. These include Critical Care, Diabetology, Nephrology and Dialysis, High Risk Obstetrics, Neonatology and a Comprehensive Rehabilitation Centre for children with special needs.
